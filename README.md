# JSoup-Tonner-Check-Project

A simple JSoup project to scrap some informations from a web site (local IP) about printer tonners if it's empty or the printer does have a code error.

# How it works?

JSoup is a HTML parser who get the information (scrapping) from a site to visualize or modify. This Java project starts entering in a printer IP Address and scrap the information about status/tonner status (empty or full) and if the tonner is removed. After that, it returns in a command line if the printer status is ok or not.

The project is useful for IT Support roles who needs to constant check if the company printers have some trouble/error or need to change the tonner. It's not something big but it's really useful, feel free to test.
